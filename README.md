# diet_planner
Diet Planner, as the name suggests, is a diet planner to manage foods macronutrients values to build a diet.

It's a API oriented backend project based on Express. I'm ussing a simple docker container as database with MySQL.
I'm using node inside a docker container as well.

That's more or less what I working with, I will be updating it as the development growths.
